<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurobiology ELISA Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct ELISA</li><li>Sandwich ELISA</li><li>Indirect ELISA</li><li>Competitive ELISA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neurobiology ELISA kits encompass various types tailored for specific applications. Direct ELISA simplifies detection by attaching a labeled antibody directly to the target. Sandwich ELISA employs two antibodies—one for capture and another for detection—providing greater specificity and sensitivity. Indirect ELISA utilizes a secondary antibody to amplify the signal, enhancing detection of the primary antibody. Competitive ELISA involves a competition between the target and a labeled antigen, quantifying the concentration of the target based on inhibition levels. Each type serves different neurobiological research needs.</p></p>
