<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerosol Overcap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spay Through Overcaps</li><li>Traditional "Dust-Cover" Overcaps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aerosol overcap market primarily consists of two types: spray-through overcaps and traditional "dust-cover" overcaps. Spray-through overcaps are designed to allow the aerosol product to be dispensed directly through the cap, enhancing usability and convenience. In contrast, traditional dust-cover overcaps serve mainly as protective barriers, shielding the nozzle from dust and debris when not in use, but do not facilitate spraying. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining product integrity and ensuring user satisfaction in aerosol applications.</p></p>
