<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 4,4\'-Oxydianiline Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sublimation</li><li>Recrystallization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 4,4'-Oxydianiline market can be categorized based on purification methods: sublimation and recrystallization. Sublimation involves heating the compound to turn it into vapor, effectively separating impurities as they do not sublimate. Recrystallization, on the other hand, relies on dissolving the compound in a suitable solvent, allowing pure crystals to form as the solution cools. Both methods are essential for obtaining high-purity 4,4'-Oxydianiline, which is crucial for applications in dyes, pharmaceuticals, and polymer production.</p></p>
