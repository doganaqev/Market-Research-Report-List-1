<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kidney Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Kidney dialysis machines are primarily categorized into two types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis machines filter blood through an external device, removing wastes and excess fluids before returning the clean blood to the body. This method typically occurs in clinics or at home with specialized equipment. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdominal cavity as a natural filter, where a dialysis solution is infused and circulation helps remove waste and liquid. Both methods are essential in managing kidney failure.</p></p>
